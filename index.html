    <p>“I am someone who has suffered from mental health issues my whole life.
      Been in and out of talk and group therapy for years.
      And, I never seemed to be able to go as deep or be received as deeply as with my sessions with Gayle.
      Her knowledge and continued studies of deeply rooted Trauma Issues, Coping Strategies and Integration breaks down the walls of Fear into Self Loving Awareness.
      I am someone who highly values mental health and I have found my lifelong Spiritual Advisor in Gayle.”
