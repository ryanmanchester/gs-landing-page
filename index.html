      <p>
        I am a certified practitioner in trauma recovery, and emotional integration.
        I use different techniques to help people become aware of the armor and defenses that keep them stuck and find ways to integrate (not change or banish), and reawaken their true selves.
        I utilize therapeutic modalities such as Bioenergetics, Inner child and Parts Work to help people gain a deeper understanding of themselves and empower them to live an authentic life.
        We are an interdependent species that needs and thrives on relationships.
        Relationships with ourselves and others - which, in reality, reflect each other.
        When we feel abandoned or shamed for who we are, relationships feel toxic.
        We learn to mistrust others and ourselves. We feel the need to control or manipulate in order to get our needs met...or flee from relationships altogether.  Learning to honor our boundaries and understand the root of our mistrust is essential in moving toward healing and attracting the kind of relationships that feel good.
        I am eager to guide and help you uncover the aspects of yourself that are keeping you from creating the life you desire, and get you on the road to a more joyous life than you ever thought possible.

      <p>“I am someone who has suffered from mental health issues my whole life.
        Been in and out of talk and group therapy for years.
        And, I never seemed to be able to go as deep or be received as deeply as with my sessions with Gayle.
        Her knowledge and continued studies of deeply rooted Trauma Issues, Coping Strategies and Integration breaks down the walls of Fear into Self Loving Awareness.
        I am someone who highly values mental health and I have found my lifelong Spiritual Advisor in Gayle.”<br>

        "I love Gayle. Her enthusiasm and kindness makes me to look forward to each session.
        She has an amazing intuition that allows her to guide you through the deepest places of your soul to heal each inch of it.
        She has all the qualities of a healer."<br>
